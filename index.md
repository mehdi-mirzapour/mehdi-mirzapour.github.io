## Welcome to my personal website

My name is [Mehdi Mirzapour](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mehdimirzapour/). My main field of interests are Deep Learning and Symbolic AI. Currently, I am working on different approaches on finding semantic information that is hidden in the texts, images and voices.

I have done my PhD research (2015-2018) in Computer Science (Computational Semantics, NLP) at Montpellier Univ, France. I have also done two postdocs in Montpellier Univ and Tours University. Currently I am working as NLP R&D Engineer at ContentSide, France and Semanticist advisor (part-time) for Pat Inc Palo Alto, USA.
