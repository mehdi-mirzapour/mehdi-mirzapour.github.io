## Welcome to my website

My main fields of interest are Natural Language Processing/Understanding and Computational Linguistics/Semantics. I am interested in both (logical) rule-based and statistical approaches. 

I have done my PhD research (2015-2018) in Computer Science (Computational Semantics) at University of Montpellier, France. I have a B.Sc. in Electronic Engineering from SBU and a Master in Logic from ATU in Iran. My PhD title is "Modeling Preferences for Ambiguous Utterance Interpretations" under the supervisions of Prof. Christian Retoré and Dr. Jean-Philippe Prost. Currently, I am working as a Research and Development Engineer at ContentSide (Lyon, France) in which I research on NLP/Semantic Platform. We use deep learning algorithms and SOTA architectures such as Transformers, LSTMs, CNNs and MLPs for variety of different NLP tasks. Before that, I was working in Tours University in the project TALAD, funded by the French National Research Agency (ANR), a multidisciplinary research that brings together speech analysts and automatic natural language processing ​​around the issue of detection and analysis of nominations in media speech and politics using machine learning models for coreference resolution. I, also, did a Postdoc at LIRMM, working at PractiKPharma, a collaborative research project funded by the French NationalResearch Agency (ANR) in the biomedical domain of Pharmacogneomics in which I was more focused on French Contextualizer using NLP techniques and Ontology technologies.

I have around 9 years of working experience in industrial companies such as Ericsson and Nokia. My last position in Ericsson company was Implementation Manager. I have also consulted companies in Geospatial Information System (GIS) for around 5 years which had the outcome of 9 successful national projects for the Iran Ministries of Energy and Agriculture.
